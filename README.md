<b>Correlation between stock prices & coronavirus dataset Using Quantmod</b>
<br><br>From World Health Organization - On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new, we do not know how it affects people.
<br><br>Everyday information on the affected people can give some interesting insights when it is made available to the broader data science community. Johns Hopkins University has made an excellent dashboard using the affected cases data.
<br><br>To analysis the global economic impact of pandamic novel coronavirus, the task is to find correlation between stock price and confirmed cases, cumutative cases and death due to the covid19 virus. The outcome of this analysis is a plot of correlation between stock index and coronavirus dataset. The code is written in R-Programming Language.
<br><br>The additional tasks performed instead of performing analysis directly, a portfolio of 6 stocks are defined and Heatmap of portfolio, impact of portfolio due to coronavirus is analysed.
